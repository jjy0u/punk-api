This project set by _nology was a task to build a website rendering data from the Punk API. The specifications were to have a sidenav, a main section with all the beer cards with important information about the beer, a search input to search through the beers, and three filters that allow filtering based on high alcohol, the classic range, and high acidity. I wanted to put what I had learnt in react to practice so I added a couple more features such as links and separate pages on each of the beers. These are the goals I had set for this project:

Beer images when you hover over the image will tell you the name and brief information with a “read more” which pops up a overlay with more detailed information about the beer including ingredients and pairings etc

Beers card:
-When you hover over the card, a small overlay comes up with the name and a “quick look” 

- Quick look opens up a popup with some more information. If you click full information  on this it will redirect you to the page for that beer. 
- If you click the image of the beer this will also redirect you to the page.

- Have a filter button that pops up the side nav, which has the filters on it
- Potentially add a price filter to that

- Potential things for the separate page:
- Name
- Price
- Description
